this is a SQL project about an app developer aspiring to make an app for the Apple store

 The StakeHolders:

Our stakeholder is an aspiring app developer who needs data driven-insights to decide what type of app to build.

Questions that they want answers to:

What app categories are most popular?

What price should I set?

How can I maximize user ratings?

(During this time we are coding and you can check out the detailed process throughout in SQLite.sql code.)

The conclusion for our recommendations to the app developer.

1. Paid apps have better ratings than free apps.

2. Apps that support between 10 and 30 languages will have better ratings.

3. Finance and Book apps have lower ratings

4. Apps with longer descriptions have better ratings.

5. A new app needs to aim for a 3.5 or above rating

6. Games and Entertainment are highly saturated and have more competition.
